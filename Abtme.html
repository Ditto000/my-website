			Hailed originally from Lagos, Nigeria and moved to the United States a few years ago full of excitement for new adventures, and I haven't been disappointed. Well, until the recent occurance in our government, which is a topic for another day and audience :). The transition from Nigeria to America was a very interesting one considering the different of the two cities, Lagos and Athens, WV. Lagos is considered one of the biggest cities in Africa with a population of over 17.5 million people. Athens,WV on the other hand was a direct opposite and it took a while to get acclamatized. I lived in West Virginia for over 3 years before eventually moving to New York.

			I run a small moving company of about 5 employees which I'm hoping to expand soon. I haved tried my hand at a few different industries before settling for the moving as it seems New Yorkers are always moving and now I am looking into moving into IT. I'm super excited for the journey ahead with this web development program.

			I do consider myself an easy-going person and I try to make the most of each day. You can usaully find me listening to music, watching movies, playing FIFA, or reading a John Grisham novel during my free time. I love watching sports and I'm a <em> huge</em> Arsenal football fan.
